				<p class="blocktext">Colour Pallete, Logo, Font, Graphics <br><br> I decided to go with a quite vibrant colourscheme which i thought appropriate to the app idea. The colours are also cohesive and contrasting to be easy on the eye.<br><br>A simple yet elegant logo has been created to represent the Weatherly app.<br><br> I chose two different fonts Calibri and Rasa, which i will use in thier various styles to complement the stripped back symbols. Although they belong to different font families I find that their combination work well together.<br><br>I have kept the graphics very simplistic to go along with a minimalistic theme. </p>
